# chatta_backend

This is the backend part of the Chatta aplication, a real time chat application.
Here is where cool things happens, that is enable a socket.io endpoint to manage client-server communication through websockets.

LIVE-Project: https://elegant-leakey-b744fc.netlify.app/

INSTRUCTIONS (in order):
· git clone <repository_url>
· npm install
· npm start

IMPORTANT: If you want to run it locally, as it comes with mysql integration you have to have mysql and provide your local machine credentials, you shoudn't connect to my remote database because it's in a free tier and is not gonna support more than 3 connections at the same time, that's why I hosted the project so everyone can test at once.
